# I. Introduction

## What is Classical Mechanics?

> Physics deals with the properties and nature of Matter and Energy. Throughout Humanities never-ending quest to understand everything around us, Physicists have used Math to delve deeply into what makes up our world. Classical Mechanics is the quest to combine macroscopic objects and describe them mathematically. For Example 
>
> > EQN \(0.1\)

$$
F=GMm/r^2
$$

## How will Python come into play?

> Python will be our tool throughout this course. When you solve a Physics Problem, I don't only want you to know it on Paper and Pencil, but I also want you to learn how to develop Methods using Python that you can use to quickly solve similar problems, as well as learn the Python Language! If you have no Prior Computational experience, Great! You are right where you should be.
